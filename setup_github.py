Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/policy-gradient-active-learning.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes: `python -m pytest tests/`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Create a Pull Request

## üß™ Development Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Check code quality
black src/
flake8 src/
mypy src/
```

## üìù Code Style

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

## üìö Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update type hints
- Include examples in docstrings

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Python version
- PyTorch version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages/stack traces

## üí° Feature Requests

For new features, please:
- Check existing issues first
- Describe the use case
- Explain why it would be valuable
- Consider implementation complexity

## üìã Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Write clear commit messages
