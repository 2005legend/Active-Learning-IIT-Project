## 🎯 Next Steps (Do These Now)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `policy-gradient-active-learning`
3. Description: `Reinforcement Learning-based Active Learning for Animal Classification - 75% data reduction with minimal performance loss`
4. Set to **Public**
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect and Push to GitHub
Copy your repository URL from GitHub, then run:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/policy-gradient-active-learning.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Settings (After Upload)
1. **Add Topics**: Go to repository settings → Add topics:
   - `machine-learning`
   - `active-learning` 
   - `reinforcement-learning`
   - `pytorch`
   - `computer-vision`
   - `streamlit`
   - `deep-learning`

2. **Repository Description**: 
   ```
   🐾 Reinforcement Learning-based Active Learning for Animal Classification. Achieves 93.78% accuracy using only 25% of labeled data through REINFORCE policy gradient optimization.
   ```

3. **Enable Features**:
   - ✅ Issues
   - ✅ Discussions  
   - ✅ Projects
   - ✅ Wiki
