# GitHub Setup Checklist

## Files Created for GitHub

### Core Documentation
- [x] `README_GITHUB.md` - Comprehensive project README
- [x] `LICENSE` - MIT License
- [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- [x] `.gitignore` - Enhanced gitignore for ML projects

### Development Files
- [x] `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- [x] `git_setup.bat` - Windows git initialization script
- [x] `git_setup.sh` - Linux/Mac git initialization script

### Project Structure
- [x] Enhanced `.gitignore` (excludes large files, keeps important results)
- [x] Proper file organization
- [x] Sample data information

## Pre-Upload Checklist

### 1. Review and Customize
- [ ] Update author information in `README_GITHUB.md`
- [ ] Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
- [ ] Update email and contact information
- [ ] Review project description and results

### 2. File Management
- [ ] Ensure large files are properly ignored (.pth, datasets, logs)
- [ ] Keep important result files (metrics.json, curves.json)
- [ ] Verify test images are included
- [ ] Check that source code is complete

### 3. Git Setup (Choose one method)

#### Method A: Using Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
git_setup.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x git_setup.sh
./git_setup.sh
```

#### Method B: Manual Setup
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Policy Gradient Active Learning project"
```

### 4. GitHub Repository Creation
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `policy-gradient-active-learning`
3. Description: "Reinforcement Learning-based Active Learning for Animal Classification"
4. Set to Public
5. Don't initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Create repository

### 5. Connect and Push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/policy-gradient-active-learning.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Included in GitHub Upload

### Source Code
- Complete Python implementation

- Processed datasets

### Instructions for Users
Users will need to:
1. Download datasets from Kaggle/CIFAR
2. Run preprocessing scripts
3. Train models using provided scripts
4. Generate their own results
